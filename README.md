## Writeup
When we began our project, we knew Noti would need access to our Gmail account. The first step towards that was getting the Gmail API. All I needed to do was just go to the Google APIs site and follow along with their steps. I agreed to their terms and such, and eventually got access to my credentials.JSON, which is my API key, something my program will need to get access to my Gmail's inbox.
